Overview of OSPFv2
===================

OSPF is an interior gateway protocol(IGP) based on the concept of a link-state databse(LSDB).As such,each OSPF-speaking
router in the network attempts to form an adjacency with each neighboring OSPF router.When these adjacencies are in pla
ce, each router genenrates and floods link-state advetisements(LSAs) into the network i a reliable manner.

The LSAs are placed into the LSDB on each router where the shortest-path-first(SPF) algorithm is run to find the best path 
to each end node in the network.

OSPF routers send out Hello packets to form and maintain adjacencies with their neighbors.

OSPF uses IP protocol number 89 and the all OSPF routers multicast address of 224.0.0.5 to flood LSAs.OSPF routers forward
all LSAs through all OSPF-configured interfaces except the one on which an LSA was received.

the LSAs are the installed into the OSPF databse ,whcih forms the topology map of the network.Finally,the SFP aigorithm is 
calculated to detemine the shortest path to each destination subnet.
